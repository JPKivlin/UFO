# UFO

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table to provide UFO sighting analysis as filtered by the user.  This dynamic table allows for multiple filter inputs for a more robust analysis.

## Results
The user can input analysis criteria into any of the 5 created filters.  This will filter the dynamic table allowing for the user to analyze the data.

## Summary
In summary, this webpage is the cutting edge in dynamic tables.  By using multiple filters at once, the user can take a deeper-dive into the data.  One draw back is that there is no way to view any graphic data based on the filters by region.  Two improvements would be to add in a search history setting, and an area map of sightings based on the filtered inputs.
